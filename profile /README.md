<h1 align="center">Welcome to Omni-Fi 🇲🇺</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>The premier financial data aggregation platform for Mauritius.</strong>
</p>

<br/>

## 🚀 About Us

Omni-Fi is bridging the "Open Banking" gap in Mauritius. We build secure, production-grade infrastructure that empowers local Fintechs, corporate treasuries, and lending institutions to seamlessly access financial data. 

Our multi-tenant API and drop-in UI components allow developers to securely authenticate end-users, extract historical transactions, and consolidate cash flow data across all 13 Mauritian banking institutions.

## 🛠️ What We Build

* **Core API:** A unified, robust REST API strictly compliant with the Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) standard.
* **Omni-Fi Link Widget:** A secure, embeddable React SDK that handles bank selection, credential tokenization, and complex Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) flows directly within the client application.
* **Resilient Extraction Engine:** A highly scalable, asynchronous scraping fleet powered by Agentic AI auto-healing logic to maintain continuous connection stability.
* **Developer Platform:** A self-serve developer portal with interactive documentation, sandbox environments, and granular webhook controls.

## 🛡️ Security by Design

As a core financial infrastructure provider, security and data isolation are woven into our DNA. 
* **Zero Plaintext Storage:** End-user credentials never touch persistent storage in plaintext. We utilize strict Envelope Encryption via Key Management Service (KMS).
* **Multi-Tenant Isolation:** Database architecture strictly scopes data access by API Client.
* **Compliance Ready:** Our infrastructure and operational processes are architected to meet European security standards.
